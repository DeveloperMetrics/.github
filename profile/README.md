This organization contains multiple implementations of DORA metrics. It is a place to discuss developer and DevOps metrics, such as DORA, SPACE, and DevEx. 

There is a lot of confusion in the industry about the usage of DORA, and how it fits into SPACE and DevEx. We think they are all complementary, and DORA, while not perfect, is the best we have - and we truly mean that in a positive light. 

We also recognize most organizations are still struggling to reach DevOps maturity - with some pockets of maturity - especially outside of tech companies. From this perspective, we see a lot of value in getting a rough idea of where we are with DORA metrics - using an order of magnitude measurement hours/days/weeks. For most projects, this level of measurement is enough - and for more focused, strategic projects (usually easy to identify as they have scum masters, SRE's, SLA's, and/or continuous deployment practices), can dive in deeper and look for more accurate metrics.

Also important to point out that all metrics can be 'gamed', and shouldn't be used to compare different projects. Everyone and everything is different.
